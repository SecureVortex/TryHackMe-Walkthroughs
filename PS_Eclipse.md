Scenario : You are a SOC Analyst for an MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider) company called TryNotHackMe .
A customer sent an email asking for an analyst to investigate the events that occurred on Keegan's machine on Monday, May 16th, 2022 . The client noted that the machine is operational, but some files have a weird file extension. The client is worried that there was a ransomware attempt on Keegan's device. 
Your manager has tasked you to check the events in Splunk to determine what occurred in Keegan's device. 
Happy Hunting!

Virtual Machine

You can use the Attack Box or OpenVPN to access the Splunk instance.  The IP for the Splunk instance is MACHINE_IP . 
Note : Wait for the virtual machine to fully load. If you see errors after 2 minutes, refresh the URL until it loads. 

**Q1. A suspicious binary was downloaded to the endpoint. What was the name of the binary?**
I started by entering * in the search bar and setting the time range to "All Time" to view all available logs. To refine the results, I added additional fields such as Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP, and Destination Port.
Next, I filtered by Destination Port 443 to focus specifically on HTTPS connections. As shown in the image, three distinct values are returned, one of which corresponds to the downloaded binary.

**Q2. What is the address the binary was downloaded from? Add http:// to your answer & defang the URL.**

I searched for OUTSTANDING_GUTTER.exe in the query and included additional fields such as ParentCommandLine.

I could see the Windows executable used to download the suspicous binary in the same ParentCommandLine field.

Answer: _C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe_


**Q4. What command was executed to configure the suspicious binary to run with elevated privileges?**

Under the CommandLine field, I can see the value.

Answer: _"C:\Windows\system32\schtasks.exe" /Create /TN OUTSTANDING_GUTTER.exe /TR C:\Windows\Temp\COUTSTANDING_GUTTER.exe /SC ONEVENT /EC Application /MO *[System/EventID=777] /RU SYSTEM /f_


**Q5. What permissions will the suspicious binary run as? What was the command to run the binary with elevated privileges? (Format: User + ; + CommandLine)**

From the decoded PowerShell command, itâ€™s clear that the scheduled task was configured to run under the SYSTEM account. The attacker then used schtasks.exe /Run to manually trigger this task, causing the binary to execute with SYSTEM-level privileges. I merged the details as specified in the format provided in the question.

**Q7. A PowerShell script was downloaded to the same location as the suspicious binary. What was the name of the file?**

To investigate this, I searched for '.ps1' to filter PowerShell-related logs. In the first result under TargetFilename, I found the script that had been downloaded to the same location as the previously identified suspicious binary.

By searching for .jpg or .png image files, the first log entry reveals the image file that was created by the ransomware.
